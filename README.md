# GPT Operator

**Enhance your GPT applications with external operations**

GPT Operator (`gptop`) serves as a [call operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_assistance) for your application. Simply provide `gptop` with a prompt, and it will determine the required external operation to fulfill the prompt and, if desired, execute that operation on your behalf.

## Features

* Execute operations based on a given prompt
* Create, update, and remove operations in vector database

## Requirements

* Pinecone Vector Database Index
* OpenAI access to gpt-4

## Installation

Install the released version via pip:

```bash
$ pip install gptop
```

[WARNING] The package is currently in Alpha stage, so please exercise caution before using it in production.
